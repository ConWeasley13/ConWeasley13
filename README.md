- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nick and I go by @ConWeasley13. I'm a 31 YOM and I've been working in software development since November 2020.
I have a B.S. in Biology and am a CA and Nationally registered paramedic. I was working during the height of the pandemic and got some experience. 
However, I found that some of the calls were affecting me emotionally and mentally and I needed to step away for my mental health.

I started out programming learning Python from codecademy and used that to understand some of the computer science basics but soon found that there was much more to master.
I've dabbled in html, css, javascript, and C++ getting accquainted with how the languages differ and their uses.
In addition, I've done work in Microsoft Sharepoint making websites with their framework along with using Microsoft PowerApps and Powerautomate to connect to Sharepoint lists.

- Iâ€™m interested in cybersecurity analysis specifically working as a penetration tester/ ethical hacker. I see the role as a meaningful way to help other programmers keep their work safe and to help protect the average user from those with malicious intent.
