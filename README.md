- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nick and I go by @ConWeasley13.
I have a B.S. in Biology and am a CA and Nationally registered paramedic. I am very thankful to have worked with some truly incredible paramedics, emts, and trauma nurses. 
Over time, I realized that the work was starting to take a toll on my mental health and needed a change, which is how I fell in love with programming and IT in December 2020.  

I started out programming learning Python from codecademy and used that to understand some of the computer science basics but soon found that there was much more to master.
I've dabbled in html, css, javascript, and C++ getting accquainted with how the languages differ and their uses.
In addition, I've done work in Microsoft Sharepoint making websites with their framework along with using Microsoft PowerApps and Powerautomate to connect to Sharepoint lists.

Iâ€™m interested in cybersecurity analysis specifically working as a penetration tester/ ethical hacker. I see the role as a meaningful way to help other programmers keep their work safe and to serve people by protecting them from those with malicious intent.
